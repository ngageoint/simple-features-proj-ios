# Simple Features Projection iOS

#### Simple Features Projection Lib ####

The Simple Features Libraries were developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.caci.com/bit-systems/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

### About ###

[Simple Features Projection](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-proj-ios/) is an iOS library for performing projection conversions between [Simple Feature](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-ios) Geometries.

### Usage ###

#### Transform ####

```objectivec

// SFGeometry *geometry = ...

PROJProjection *projection1 =
    [PROJProjectionFactory projectionWithAuthority:PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG
    andIntCode:PROJ_EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR];
PROJProjection *projection2 =
    [PROJProjectionFactory projectionWithAuthority:PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG
    andIntCode:PROJ_EPSG_WORLD_GEODETIC_SYSTEM];

SFPGeometryTransform *transform =
    [SFPGeometryTransform transformFromProjection:projection1
    andToProjection:projection2];

SFGeometry *transformed = [transform transformGeometry:geometry];

[transform destroy];

```

### Build ###

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-proj-ios/workflows/Build%20&%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-proj-ios/actions/workflows/build-test.yml)

**IMPORTANT** -
Be sure your Mac has the `autoconf`, `automake`, and `glibtoolize` utilities.  These are required to build
the [PROJ](https://github.com/ngageoint/PROJ) dependency.  Without them, `pod install` will fail.  The easiest way to get these is to [`brew install`](https://brew.sh/) them:
```
brew install automake
brew install libtool
```

Build this repository using Xcode and/or CocoaPods:

    pod repo update
    pod install

Open sf-proj-ios.xcworkspace in Xcode or build from command line:

    xcodebuild -workspace 'sf-proj-ios.xcworkspace' -scheme sf-proj-ios build

Run tests from Xcode or from command line:

    xcodebuild test -workspace 'sf-proj-ios.xcworkspace' -scheme sf-proj-ios -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

### Include Library ###

See the [above note](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-proj-ios#build) about `automake` and `glibtoolize`.

Include this repository by specifying it in a Podfile using a supported option.

Pull from [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/sf-proj-ios):

    pod 'sf-proj-ios', '~> 7.0.0'

If you use `use_modular_headers!` in your Podfile, disable modular headers for the [PROJ](https://github.com/ngageoint/PROJ) dependency:

    pod 'sf-proj-ios', '~> 7.0.0'
    pod 'PROJ', :modular_headers => false

Pull from GitHub:

    pod 'sf-proj-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-proj-ios.git', :branch => 'master'
    pod 'sf-proj-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-proj-ios.git', :tag => '7.0.0'

Include as local project:

    pod 'sf-proj-ios', :path => '../simple-features-proj-ios'

### Swift ###

To use from Swift, import the sf-proj-ios bridging header from the Swift project's bridging header

    #import "sf-proj-ios-Bridging-Header.h"

#### Transform ####

```swift

// var geometry: SFGeometry = ...

let projection1: PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withAuthority: PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG, andIntCode: PROJ_EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR)
let projection2: PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withAuthority: PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG, andIntCode: PROJ_EPSG_WORLD_GEODETIC_SYSTEM)

let transform: SFPGeometryTransform = SFPGeometryTransform(from: projection1, andTo: projection2)

let transformed: SFGeometry = transform.transform(geometry)

transform.destroy()

```
